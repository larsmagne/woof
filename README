This small program is designed to generate HTML to be displayed when
viewing Gwene threads.

The interface is pretty simple -- you specify the output file, and all
the news spool files you wish to display, and woof will then generate
one HTML file, where drastically shortened versions of each Gwene
article are displayed.  Only the first 100 characters in each message
are included.

The exception to this is for comments posted on Gwene, where the
complete message is output.
